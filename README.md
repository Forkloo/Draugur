Draugur
=======

Ghost theme based on the default Casper theme and inspired by GitHub and Medium for a simple design focused on readability. Good for code.

### [Demo](//gustavlindqvist.se) / [Download](https://github.com/reedyn/Draugur/releases)

## Features
#### Cover page
The landing page is very similar to the default one of Casper, although without the site logotype.

#### Built with SASS
If you know HTML and CSS making modifications to the theme should be super simple.

#### Mobile First - Responsive
Draugur is responsive with a mobile first approach.

#### Code Syntax Highlighting
Draugur has Syntax highlighting using Highlight.js and GitHub's syntax colors.

#### CDevelopment
The following features are currently under development:

* Featured images (using the {{content words=0}}-hack)
* Disqus comments
* Tags (not implemented right now as they aren't really being used by Ghost)
* Date (With a time-since implementation)

Ghost is still a work in progress with many features not yet implemented, as Ghost gets updated new features will be added to Draugur.
